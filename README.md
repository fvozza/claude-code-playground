# Playing around with Claude Code

- Inspired by [this post](https://gist.github.com/simonw/ba1e9fa26fc8af08934d7bc0805b9b80)
- Asked Claude Desktop to create the basic code
- Moved to Claude Code to:
  - Create the github repository
  - Check the code and fix errors
  - Add some functionality
  - Add an http server mode
  - Dockerization
